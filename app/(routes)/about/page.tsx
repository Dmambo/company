            WebCon was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: to bridge the gap
            between local businesses and the digital world. As technology
            enthusiasts in Guinea Conakry, we saw firsthand how many local
            businesses were missing out on the opportunities the internet could
            offer. Our mission became clear—empower these businesses with
            high-quality, customized websites that truly reflect their brand and
            drive growth.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            From our humble beginnings, we’ve grown into a dedicated team of web
            developers, designers, and digital strategists who share a common
            passion for technology and innovation. We started with a few small
            projects, helping local businesses establish their online presence. As
            we gained experience and built our portfolio, we expanded our services
            to include local SEO, maintenance, and support, ensuring our clients
            had all the tools they needed for success.
